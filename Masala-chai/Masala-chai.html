    <p>Masala chai is a popular beverage throughout South Asia, originating in early modern Indian subcontinent.
         Chai is made by brewing black tea in milk and water and then sweetening with sugar. 
         Adding aromatic herbs and spices creates masala chai, although chai is often prepared unspiced</p>

    <p>Ingredients You Need
        Masala chai is made with a mix of staple ingredients that every Indian kitchen has.

        <h3>Spices and Herbs I Add</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Cinnamon</b> – A spice known for its fragrant, warm, woody aroma; cinnamon is also antibacterial, antifungal and has antioxidant properties.
         <li></li><b>Cloves</b></li> – Imparts a nice mild sweet pungent taste to the tea. Cloves also have antioxidant properties and are antimicrobial.
            <li><b>Green Cardamom</b></li> – Infuses a lovely sweet fragrance. You can choose to either crush the whole green pods or add ground cardamom powder. Cardamom is good for digestion and a good mouth and breath freshener as well.
                <li><b>Ginger</b></li> – It is a warming pungent herb and can be added either crushed or grated. Ginger is very good to deal with morning sickness and nausea. It is also antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and good for digestion.

                            I have also shared a post on Herbal Tea with detailed information about different spices used in Indian tea.
        
        <h3>Which Tea To Use</h3>
        <p>In Indian homes, the type of tea that is used to make our everyday chai is black tea that comes in granular form. There are two kinds that are used – Tea Dust and CTC. Both are referred to as tea powder here.</p>
        
        <p>CTR refers to Crush, Tear and Curl. The tea leaves are crushed, torn and curled using cylindrical rollers at various stages. This processed tea has a granular texture or can be in the form of pellets and is called CTC or Mamri tea.</p>
        
        <p>A stronger tea variety like Assam tea is the most preferred CTC tea to make this drink. But some folks also prefer a lighter and milder tea like the Darjeeling tea. There are premade mixes of both Assam and Darjeeling tea or Assam and Nilgiri available that can be used.</p>
        
        <p>We always make our chai with Assam tea powder as the robust and bold spices harmonize with the intense flavors of this tea.</p>
        
        <p>You can also opt to use tea leaves or tea bags. If using tea leaves then steep them in the water for 2 to 4 minutes to get the desired flavor in the brew.</p>
        
        <p>In India, we can easily buy the tea powder in any grocery store. If you live outside India, then buy Assam tea powder or tea leaves or tea bags from any Indian grocery store or online. Preferably try to buy organic tea powder or leaves.</p>
        
        <p>This Masala chai recipe serves 2 to 3. It can be easily halved, doubled or tripled by simply adjusting the amount of ingredients. Serve Masala tea steaming hot on its own or with Indian snacks such pakora, Samosa, Aloo Tikki, sandwiches, nankhatai or biscuits.</p>
